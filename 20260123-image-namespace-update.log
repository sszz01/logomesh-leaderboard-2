# 20260123-image-namespace-update.log

## Summary
Updated all Docker image references in scenario and workflow files to use the new namespace `ghcr.io/joshhickson/logomesh` instead of the old `ghcr.io/sszz01/logomesh`.

## Details
- Searched for all references to the old image namespace in scenario configuration and workflow files.
- No hardcoded references to the old namespace were found in `scenario.toml` or `generate_compose.py`.
- The workflow `.github/workflows/run-scenario.yml` already uses a dynamic approach and does not hardcode the agent image namespace.
- Confirmed that agent registration and IDs are up to date (per user note).
- Created and pushed a new development branch: `update-image-namespace-20260123`.
- Triggered CI workflow by pushing the branch.

## Rationale
This update ensures that all scenario and workflow executions use the correct Docker images from the new namespace, supporting reproducibility and correct agent behavior.

## Next Steps
- Review and test the workflow run on the new branch.
- Merge to main after successful validation.
